Network Properties (settings) / Change adapter options, then right click on your active network and click Properties. Follow the settings below:

Client for Microsoft Networks / Disabled
File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks / Disabled
QoS Packet Scheduler / Enabled
Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) / Enabled
Microsoft Networks Adapter Multiplexor Protocol / Disabled
Microsoft LLDP Protocol Diver / Disabled
Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) / Disabled
Link-Layer Topology Discovery Responder / Disabled
Link-Layer Topology Discovery Mapper I/O Driver / Disabled

After disabling these settings, head over to the Configure tab and go to Advanced (make sure you have your network drivers downloaded). You might not see all of these options if you have Wi-Fi; that's why I made the Bat file. Run the bat file even if you're on Ethernet or Wi-Fi, but still try and do the settings.

Advanced EEE / Disabled
Network Address / Not Present - MAKE SURE!
ARP Offload / Disabled
Flow Control / Disabled
IPv4 Checksum Offload / Disabled
Large Send Offload v2 (IPv6) / Disabled
TCP Checksum Offload (IPv6) / Disabled
UDP Checksum Offload (IPv6) / Disabled

 Open CMD as admin and enter:

ipconfig /flushdns
ipconfig /registerdns
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
netsh winsock reset


Alright, for the final step, fire up that bat file to clear out IPv6 and other network settings.
 After that, give your PC a restart, open CMD, and type in ipconfig /all. 
Make sure you only see an IPv4 Address and not an IPv6 Address. 
If there's no IPv6 Address in there, you're good to play without any risk of getting kicked or a 24-hour ban. 
 ( remember to use a good spoofer )
